# 📋 Specifications

> *"A specification is a contract between the present and the future — it tells you not just what something does, but what it promises to always do."*

This directory contains detailed technical specifications for systems, algorithms, and architectural patterns within the Perturbarium. These documents serve as the blueprint for implementations and provide the theoretical foundation for complex systems, translating perturbations into concrete designs.

## 📋 Navigation

- **[`SineScramble.md`](SineScramble.md)** — A multi-mode symmetric cipher combining sine-wave-based permutation and substitution with dual security/performance modes.
- **[`SineShift.md`](SineShift.md)** — A framework for deterministic data permutation via sine-wave-based scrambling with three-column signal processing architecture.
- **[`Licensee.md`](Licensee.md)** — A multi-layered framework for secure software license key generation using RSA-3072 signatures and SineShift permutation.
- **[`Instamaster.md`](Instamaster.md)** — A signal-centric automated mastering pipeline with corrective EQ, multiband compression, and brickwall limiting.
- **[`gdiff.md`](gdiff.md)** — An opcodeized git diff specification providing machine-readable, granular file change representation beyond traditional line-based diffs.
- **[`Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md`](Reverse-Publickey-Identity-Verification[RPIV].md)** — A protocol for inverted asymmetric identity where private keys are public identifiers and authenticity is established through decryption.

## 🎯 Purpose

These specifications represent the bridge between theory and implementation within the Perturbarium. They provide:
- Detailed algorithmic descriptions
- Security considerations and analysis
- Performance characteristics and trade-offs
- Implementation guidelines and constraints
- Testing and validation requirements
- Structured frameworks for transforming theoretical perturbations into practical systems

> *"A good specification is like a good map — it doesn't just show you where to go, it helps you understand the terrain and choose the best path."*

## 🏗️ Role in the Perturbarium

Specifications serve as the architectural layer within the Perturbarium container. They translate the theoretical perturbations from Axia and the experimental concepts from Inkspill into structured, implementable designs. They provide the blueprints that guide the transformation of abstract ideas into concrete systems, ensuring that the perturbations are not just creative chaos but purposeful, well-defined structures that can be built upon and extended.

> *"A specification is where an idea stops being a dream and starts becoming a plan."*
