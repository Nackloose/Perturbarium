# Inkspill

> A loose collection of drafts, notes, fragments, and half-formed thoughts — the messy beginnings before ideas become Axia.

## What is Inkspill?

**Inkspill** is the scratchpad, the journal, the floor scattered with pages. It's where ideas arrive in raw form — unpolished, unfiltered, and in-progress.

This is not a place for polish or permanence. It's where:
- Fragments are dropped before they're connected
- Drafts are written without fear of being right
- Thoughts are captured before they're lost
- Notes, experiments, and sketches live freely

Some of these spills will evolve into structured truths. Some won't. That's the point.

## Contents

Current structure:

- `notes/` — raw thoughts, outlines, observations  
- `assembly-tracer.md` — full technical writeup: Assembly Tracer, a real-time application performance analysis system with micro-pool architecture and Bungee Wrapping trampoline features
- `assembly-tracer.spec.md` — detailed technical specification for Assembly Tracer implementation
- `blake3-genetics.md` — exploration of Blake3 hash function genetic algorithms
- `fft_compression_concept.md` — FFT-based compression concept exploration
- `react-mono.md` — React monorepo architecture rulebook and best practices for cross-platform native React deployables

_Naming and structure may be inconsistent — and that's fine. Some files are full documents, others are fragments or living drafts. Folders are for ongoing categories; files at the top level are often larger experiments or reference works in progress._

## Contributing

This repo is intentionally chaotic. If contributing, embrace the mess. Leave room for contradictions and unfinished thoughts.

Think of it as a **shared notebook**, not a published paper.

## Relationship to Axia

If **Axia** is the canon — the distilled and enduring truths —  
**Inkspill** is the creative chaos that comes before.

Ideas are spilled here, sifted, then (sometimes) shaped into something worthy of lasting value.
