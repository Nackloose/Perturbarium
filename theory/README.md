# 🧠 Theory

> *"Theory is the foundation upon which all practical knowledge is built. Without it, we're just guessing."*

This directory contains theoretical foundations, schemas, design systems, and aesthetic principles that form the intellectual bedrock of the systems and algorithms implemented throughout the Perturbarium. These represent the mathematical frameworks that give structure to the perturbations cultivated in the container.

## 🏗️ Role in the Perturbarium

Theory serves as the mathematical framework layer within the Perturbarium container. It provides the structured perturbations that bridge the foundational axioms of Axia with the practical specifications and implementations. Theory represents the systematic exploration of ideas, where raw concepts from Inkspill are refined into mathematical frameworks that can be rigorously studied, tested, and applied. It is where the creative chaos of the container begins to take on structured, meaningful form.

> *"Theory is where we learn to dance with the perturbations, finding the patterns in the chaos and the order in the disorder."*
